ANSWERS FOR REFLECTION QUESTION: 

In a linear search, we have to check each and every item to see if it matches the target so if you have more then 100 
values in your array it will take such a long time but with binary search, it splits the array into 2 smaller arrays and 
one of the arrays will be ignored if it does not contain the target value, using binary search is more faster then 
linear search

sorting algorithm is important for the performance of search algorithms, especially in phase 4 where we
compared binary search to linear search. Binary search is faster and efficient when the data is sorted 
because we only have to half the array, so we do not need to check each and every element in the array 
which reduces the time to search for the target, however in linear search, it checks each element one by one,
which takes a lot of time and if there is a lot of elements, it will be less efficient. If the data is not 
sorted then we have to use linear search, because binary search only worked in sorted arrays

Merge Sort or  Quick Sort have a time complexity of O(n log n), meaning they sort large datasets much faster than 
Bubble Sort or Insertion Sort which take O(nÂ²)time . and binary search operates in logarithmic time once the algorithm is
sorted
